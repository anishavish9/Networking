Computer Networking
Day 1 


Assignment 1.write some network terminology.
Basic Terms
* Network: A collection of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other.
* Node: Any device connected to a network (e.g., computer, printer, router).
* Host: A node that can be used by a human (e.g., computers, phones).
Networking Devices
* Router: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
* Switch: A device that connects devices within a single network, using MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.
* Hub: A basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a network, broadcasting data to all connected devices.
* Modem: A device that modulates and demodulates signals for data transmission over telephone lines or cable systems.
* Access Point (AP): A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
Protocols
* TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): A suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
* HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure): Protocols used for transmitting web pages over the internet.
* FTP (File Transfer Protocol): A standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files.
* DNS (Domain Name System): The system that translates domain names into IP addresses.
* SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): A protocol for sending email.
Addressing
* IP Address: A unique address assigned to each device on a network.
   * IPv4: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
   * IPv6: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
* MAC Address: A unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.
Network Topologies
* Bus Topology: All devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus).
* Star Topology: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
* Ring Topology: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring.
* Mesh Topology: Devices are interconnected, with multiple pathways for data to travel.
Network Types
* LAN (Local Area Network): A network covering a small geographic area, like a home or office.
* WAN (Wide Area Network): A network covering a large geographic area, often composed of multiple LANs.
* MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network that covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city.
Security
* Firewall: A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
* VPN (Virtual Private Network): A service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.
* Encryption: The process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorised access.
Data Transmission
* Bandwidth: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network.
* Latency: The delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction.
* Packet: A small segment of data transmitted over a network.
* Throughput: The actual rate of successful data transfer across a network.
Network Models
* OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection): A conceptual framework used to understand and implement standard protocols in seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.

B. explain how you are accessing the RPS Lab environment.


* Login : Access through credentials that provided by lab service provider
* Internet connectivity
* DNS
* Launching VM
* Secure connection made by Identity and Access Management (IAM) will provide access.
* RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol): For graphical interface access to Windows-based VMs.
* Use the resource
